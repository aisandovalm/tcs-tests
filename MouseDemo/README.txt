Mouse demo for MOD-MMA7260Q rev.B.

This demo is built with IAR for ARM 6.30.7 and uploaded with SAM-BA 2.11.

In order to update the firmware:
1) Erase the memory
	1.1) Short the jumper "Test"
	1.2) Plug-in the USB cable for 5-10 seconds.
	1.3) Unplug the cable
	1.4) Remove the jumper
2) Generate MouseDemo.bin using IAR (rebuild the project). By default it is located in: "..\MouseDemo\Project\Flash\Exe\MouseDemo.bin"
3) Plug-in the cable again and see if the "Device Manager" shows "AT91 USB to Serial Converter" in "PORTS(COM&LPT)" section.
	3.1) If you don't see it you either didn't erase the memory successfully (in this case repeat again step 1) or you have to upload drivers - in the directory of SAM-BA: "sam-ba_2.11\drv\"
3) Start SAM-BA and select: your board - "at91sam7s64-ek"; connection - the number shown in "Device Manager"
4) On the bottom menu select "Flash" and the in the "Select File Name" field the file generated by IAR project.
5) Send File
6) You will be prompted to unlock the regions and after that to lock them. Click "Yes" and reset the board.

The mouse pointer will move depending on the slope of the board.
Known bug!!! When the slope became too big the mouse pointer starts moving the opposite direction. Probably caused by overflow.
